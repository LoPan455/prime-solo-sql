Creating a new table:
======================
CREATE TABLE "songs" (
:"id" serial primary key,
"rank" integer,
"artist" varchar(80) not null,
"track" varchar(120) not null,
"published" date
);


Selecting records
============

/* Use * for wildcard SELECT all columns */
SELECT * FROM "songs";

/*Limit number of rows*/
SELECT * FROM "songs" LIMIT 10;

/* SELECT  matching on certain criteria with WHERE */
SELECT * FROM "songs" WHERE "id" = 100;


SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "songs" WHERE "track" ILIKE '%fire%';

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "songs" WHERE LOWER("track") LIKE '%fire%';

/* SELECT all columns from songs where artist has 'a' in the name AND was published after 1/1/2000 OR track has fire in the name. */

SELECT * FROM "songs"
WHERE ("artist" LIKE '%a%' AND "published" > '1/1/2000')
OR "track" ILIKE '%fire%';

/* ORDER BY column ASC (or DESC) */
SELECT * FROM "songs" ORDER BY "published" ASC;
